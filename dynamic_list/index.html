Dynamic list

Create a site with a textbox.
When the user enters text into it, add another beneath it.
When the user removes all text from a textbox, and the textbox loses focus, delete the textbox.
There should always be at least one textbox.
Style the page with CSS: add a font-stack of your choice and choose appropriate font and background colors.
